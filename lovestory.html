                            <h3>The First Letter</h3>
                            <p>Initially, Tenu reached out to me by writing a letter, referencing the love of Jesus and Peter from the Bible. I was surprised and confused, questioning what kind of friendship she wanted. I tried to avoid answering her, but she insisted.</p>

                            <p>My response was another written letter stating, "It is God's will for us to meet together this way." However, she sought a more definitive answer that reflected my acceptance of being her friend (or boyfriend).</p>

                            <h3>Distance</h3>
                            <p>I decided to distance myself from her and told her, "It is not the right time," when she approached me in person. This made her feel sad; she cried and felt hurt, but she still loved me. Despite my distance, she didn't lose hope and continued to reach out to me via phone calls and text messages. I loved her too but felt it was not the right time for us to be together.</p>

                            <p>Eventually, God brought me back to her, and we started dating in 2024. I realized it was indeed God's will for us to be together.</p>

                            <p>A few months later, she sent me a message saying, "We have to break up," which left me frustrated and downcast. The reason for her message was that her family did not want us to be together.</p>
                            <p>I felt anxious and frustrated; I tried calling her many times, but there was no answer. Finally, on a Sunday morning, she answered my call, and I felt a surge of happiness.</p>

                            <p>The day before New Year's Eve, I had a dream that strengthened our relationship and helped us bond even more. We began our dating journey anew, and I gave her a watch as a gift through Yonas, my uncle's son, which symbolized that it was the right time for us to love each other.</p>

We're excited to see how God will continue to write our story, knowing that His plans for us are good (Jeremiah 29:11). Our prayer is that through every season of life, we'll grow closer to Him and to each other.</p>
